Sure, Ramesh! Let’s go through the code step-by-step with a detailed explanation so you fully understand how it reverses a singly linked list.

⸻

✅ Original Function:

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* curr = head;

        while (curr != nullptr) {
            ListNode* nextTemp = curr->next; // 1. Save next
            curr->next = prev;               // 2. Reverse link
            prev = curr;                     // 3. Move prev ahead
            curr = nextTemp;                 // 4. Move curr ahead
        }

        return prev; // New head of the reversed list
    }
};

💡 Let’s Understand Every Line:

🔹 Step 1: Initialize Pointers

ListNode* prev = nullptr;
ListNode* curr = head;

	•	prev will eventually become the new head of the reversed list.
	•	curr starts at the original head and traverses the list.

⸻

🔄 Step 2: Loop Through the List

while (curr != nullptr) {

	•	This loop continues until curr reaches the end of the original list.

⸻

🔁 Inside the Loop: Four Steps

🧱 Step 1: Save the Next Node

ListNode* nextTemp = curr->next;

	•	We save the next node because we’re going to break curr->next.
	•	Without this, we would lose access to the rest of the list.

⸻

🔗 Step 2: Reverse the Link

curr->next = prev;

	•	The current node’s next pointer is reversed to point back to prev.

⸻

🚶 Step 3: Move prev Forward

prev = curr;

	•	Move prev to curr. This prepares for the next reversal.

⸻

🚶 Step 4: Move curr Forward

curr = nextTemp;

	•	Move curr forward to the original curr->next, which we saved in nextTemp.

⸻

🔚 After the Loop:

return prev;

	•	Once curr becomes nullptr (end of list), prev will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list.

📊 Dry Run Example:

Let’s say the list is:
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → nullptr

Initial:

prev = nullptr
curr = 1

First Iteration:
	•	nextTemp = 2
	•	1->next = nullptr
	•	prev = 1
	•	curr = 2

Now list looks like:
1 → nullptr, curr = 2

Second Iteration:
	•	nextTemp = 3
	•	2->next = 1
	•	prev = 2
	•	curr = 3

Now list looks like:
2 → 1 → nullptr, curr = 3

Repeat this, and finally:

After Fourth Iteration:
	•	prev = 4
	•	curr = nullptr

Reversed list is:
4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → nullptr

Time	O(n)
Space	O(1) (in-place)
